# Learn Algorithms and Data Structures in Java for Day-to-Day Applications

* https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/learn-algorithms-and-data-structures-java-day-day-applications-video
* Author: Tomasz Lelek
* There is example code.


## Chapter 1 : Basic Data Structures
* **Stacks**:
    * LIFO
    * When to use Stacks:
        * Undo/redo operation in word processors.
        * Expression evaluation and syntax parsing.
        * JVM are stack oriented.
    * `peek()`: returns the element at the top of the stack without removing it.
* **Queue**:
    * FIFO
    * enqueue() and
    * dequeue()
* **Linked lists**:
    * Fast insertion: O(1)
    * Fast remove: O(1)
    * Slow lookup: O(n)
    * Node: it contains data and a pointer to the next node
    * Every linked list neads a head.
    * The last node points to null
* **Arrays**:
    * Fast lookup.
