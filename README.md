# Algorithms and data structures

Trying to improve my knowledge about algorithms and data structures.
Beyond the goal of hypothetical questions in some recruitment processes (which I don't like at all), I hope it also helps me to write "better" code :-)

For the moment, I'm including lessons learned from several resources:
* The ["Cracking the coding interview" book](./cracking-the-coding-interview)
* The free Udacity course ["Algorithms and data structures for technical interviewing"](./udactiy-technical-interview)
* Packtpub ["Learning algorithms and data structures"](./packtpub-learning-algorithms-and-data-structures)
