# Cracking the coding interview
Examples and annotations of the book "Cracking the coding interview". 
Trying to improve my algorithmics skills :-)

##Five algorithm approaches
* Examplify
* Pattern Matching
* Simplify and Generalize
* Bae Case and Build
* Data Structure Brainstorm

##General advices
* Use Structures Generously
* Appropriate Code Reuse
* Modular
* Flexible and Robust
* Error Checking
** Do not make assumptions about the input, assert it!!

##Data structures
###LinkedList
* Tend not to do very well with accessing and sorting numbers.
* 
###Array
###Binary trees
Do fairly well with ordering. If the binary search tree is perfectly balanced, the top might be the median. But if there's an even number of elements, the median is actually the average of the middle two elements.

###Heap
Really ood at basic ordering and keeping track of max and mins.
