## Lesson 1: Introduction and Efficiency
* Efficiency:
    * How well you're using your computer's resources to get a particular job's done.
    * both in  time and space terms.
    * Get the most done with minimal resources.
* Big O Notation:
    * O(n), where n represents the lenght of an input to your function.
    * O(1) = O(0n + 1)
    * Think about best, worst and average scenario (e.g. for iterating through an alphabet, the average scenario would be 13 times)
    * In the end, what it matters is "the relationship": O(16n + 2) or O(29n + 2) means O(n))
    * Always specify your interviewr which case you're talking about (best, average, worst)


## Lesson 2: List-based collections
