 * 
 * Similar to binary search, mergeAlreadySortedArrays sort is a divide and conquer algorithm. The goal being to break down our problem into sub-problems and recursively continue to break those down until we have a lot of simple problems that we can easily put back together.
 *
 * Merge sort is built off the idea of comparing whole arrays instead of individual items. First, we need to take the entire array and break it into many sub-arrays by continuously splitting everything in half until everything is alone in its own array. Since the amount of sub-arrays will be some multiple of the number of items in our main array, thatâ€™s what gives us the log in O(nlogn).
