/**
 * A binary gap within a positive integer N is any maximal sequence of consecutive zeros that is surrounded by ones at both ends in the binary representation of N.
 * 1001 --> 2
 * 1000010001 --> 4
 * 10100 --> 1
 *
 * Write a function that, given a positive integer N, returns the length of its longest binary gap.
 * The function should return 0 if N doesn't contain a binary gap.

/**
 * Time and space complexity
 * - Let L be the length of the binary representation of the input number N (L = floor(log2 N) + 1 for N > 0).
 * - Converting N to its binary string takes O(L) time and O(L) space for the string.
 * - The while loop does a single pass over that string; the inner loop advances the same index, so overall it is O(L).
 * Therefore, time is O(L) which is O(log N) with respect to the numeric value N, not O(N) over an array.
 * Note: There is no input array here; we iterate over the bits of Nâ€™s binary form.
