  - https://leetcode.com/problems/split-array-largest-sum/description/
  - This problem was asked by Etsy.
    - Given an array of numbers N and an integer k, your task is to split N into k partitions such that the maximum sum of any partition is minimized. Return this sum.
    - For example, given N = [5, 1, 2, 7, 3, 4] and k = 3, you should return 8, since the optimal partition is [5, 1, 2], [7], [3, 4].

## General Hints

### TypeScript / JavaScript

- Array.shift() is O(k) because it reindexes the remaining k elements
- includes() on an array is O(k) where k is the current window size (up to n).
